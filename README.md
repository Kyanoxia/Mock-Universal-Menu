# Archival Message
Friends,

This repository will be archived for a few years until I get a linux-capable machine up and running again.  Until then, I'll have to continue work on my MacBook Pro (M2, Apple Silicon prevents dual-booting AFAIK), working with web technologies and other such stuff.  I do hope to see you there, and do feel free to fork this repo!
  
I'm not dead yet!

# Mock Universal Menu
<p align="center">
  <n>Mock Universal Menu is a Gnome-Shell extension that creates... well, a mock universal menu in the top bar.  
It looks a little something like this:</n><br>
